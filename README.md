}
```
After creation, each user is assigned a unique id (in uuid format).

## API
By default, the port for localhost is taken from .env (you can find the `example.env` file in the root of the project. Remove the `example` prefix and you can use this file)  
  
Implemented endpoint: `api/users`.


`GET api/users` - to get all users

`GET api/users/${userId}` - to get user by id (uuid)

`POST api/users` - to create record about new user and store it in database

`PUT api/users/${userId}` - to update existing user (**all fields required**)

`DELETE api/users/${userId}` - to delete existing user from database
